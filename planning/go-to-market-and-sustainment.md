# Go to Market & Sustainment

This is a draft outline for phase one of producing four separate services to drive Union Fashion, using an API (design) first strategy. This phase is actually about bringing services to market and supporting their actual usage. This is meant to act as a guide for the actual work, as well as conduct a webinar for enterprise customers.

- **Management**
  - **Gateway** - What API management gateway are we using? (ie. AWS API Gateway, Tyk, other?)
  - **Logging** - What is the logging strategy for operating an API (ie. CloudTrail, other?)
- **Documentation**
  - **Access** - Ensure all documentation is accessible to the targeted groups.
  - **Environment** - Ensuring all environments are accessible to targeted groups.
- **Validation**
  - **Mocks** - Ensure mock is in alignment with production OpenAPI truth.
  - **Documentation** - Ensure documentation is in alignment with production OpenAPI truth.
  - **Tests** - Ensure tests are in alignment with production OpenAPI truth.   
- **Monitors**
  - **Results** - Review and stay in tune with monitor results for each service.
  - **Service Level Agreement** - Are we meeting our service level agreement.
- **Reports**
  - **Team Overview** - Tune into what each team is working on and moving forward.
  - **Service Details** - Tune into reports for each of the individual services.
- **Communication (Marketing)**
  - **Blog Post** - Publish an internal, partner, or public blog post for releases.
  - **Social** - Publish release message via internal, partner, or public social channels.
  - **Newsletter** - Share release information via target audience newsletter.
- **Feedback Loop**
  - **Email** - Send direct email to stakeholders letting know service is available.
  - **Comments** - Tune into comments available for each service.
  - **Issues** - Tune into GitHub issues for each service.

If you'd like to get involved, please assume an existing persona, or add a new persona using the organizational structure on the README. Then submit GitHub issues with your feedback, or feel free to go ahead and submit a pull request for this page in the repo. We are working to keep as much of the process available via the public repository as we we possibly can, being transparent and observable in how Union Fashion comes together.

## Other Thoughts

- The name of this phase can change.
- The outline was thrown together quickly for a webinar should change.
- We need everything that will be needed to operate API listed here.
