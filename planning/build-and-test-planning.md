# Build & Test Planning

This is a draft outline for phase one of producing four separate services to drive Union Fashion, using an API (design) first strategy. This phase is purely about doing everything prior to actually delivering the API. This is meant to act as a guide for the actual work, as well as conduct a webinar for enterprise customers.

- Organizational
  - Teams - Configure team settings for our team.
  - Team Members - Add all team members to Postman teams.
  - Manage Roles - Mange the roles for all team members.
  - SSO - Ensure organization structure is using SSO.
  - Workspaces - Setup workspaces for each of the initial four services.
  - Repositories - Setup GitHub repositories for each of the initial four services.
- Schema
  - OpenAPI 3.0 - Publish OpenAPI 3.0 as the central truth.
  - GitHub Sync - Establish sync with GitHub repository.
  - Version - Establish version of APIs being developed.
- Collections
  - Generate - Publish a collection for each service being developed.
- Environment
  - Create - Add a build environment for each service being developed.
  - Variables - Establish key / values need for building each service.
- Mocks
  - Deploy - Establish a mock API for each service being developed.  
  - Share - Share the URL of mock server with rest of team.
  - Environment - Add the URL of the mock to the build environment
- Documentation
  - Publish - Publish documentation for each service being developed.   
  - Share - Share the URL of documentation with team members.
- Tests
  - Contracts - Develop contract tests for each service being developed.   
  - Integration - Develop integration tests for each service being developed.   
- Feedback Loop
  - Email - Send direct email to stakeholders letting know service is being developed.
  - Comments - Leveraging comments for each API as part of wider feedback loop.
  - Issues - Leveraging GitHub issues for each API as part of wider feedback loop.

If you'd like to get involved, please assume an existing persona, or add a new persona using the organizational structure on the README for this project. Then submit GitHub issues with your feedback, or feel free to go ahead and submit a pull request for this page in the repo. We are working to keep as much of the process available via the public repository as we we possibly can, being transparent and observable in how Union Fashion comes together.

## Other Thoughts

- The name of this phase can change.
- The outline was thrown together quickly for a webinar should change.
- We need everything that will be needed to realize this API listed here.
