# Build & Test Planning

This is a draft outline for phase one of producing four separate services to drive Union Fashion, using an API (design) first strategy. This phase is purely about doing everything prior to actually delivering the API. This is meant to act as a guide for the actual work, as well as conduct a webinar for enterprise customers.

If you'd like to get involved, please assume an existing persona, or add a new persona using the organizational structure on the README for this project. Then submit GitHub issues with your feedback, or feel free to go ahead and submit a pull request for this page in the repo. We are working to keep as much of the process available via the public repository as we we possibly can, being transparent and observable in how Union Fashion comes together.

## Other Thoughts

- This should be applied to any single API.
- This should be done using a API design first philosophy.
